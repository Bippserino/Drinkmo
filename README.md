# Drinkmo

Idea for this game came as a last resort to combat boredom in 2014, so I decided to share it with the world in hopes it will do same for the others. Design made by me.

**RULES:** Guess if the next drawn card is going to be higher or lower that previous. If you miss, drink!

**BUG:** Visual bug when answer checking which I'm too lazy to try to fix. Just refresh and try again.
